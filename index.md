IS-RX-CAPS has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initiative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifications.

The formal specification is provided in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-receiver-capabilities). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which are specified in RAML and JSON Schema).
