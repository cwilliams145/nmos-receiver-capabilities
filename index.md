## About IS-RX-CAPS


### What does it do?

- Allows an IS-04 Receiver to express parametric constraints on the types of streams that it is capable of consuming

### Why does it matter?

- Controllers need to know whether a Receiver is capable of handling a specific Sender's stream before connecting the two

### How does it work?

- Establishes an open Capabilities register in the NMOS Parameter Registers that lists specifications for parametric constraints (such as width, height, frame rate, number of channels, etc.)
- Defines how a Receiver instantiates these Parameter Constraints to make up a list of acceptable Constraint Sets, within the IS-04 'caps' attribute
- Defines how Controllers evaluate whether an IS-04 Sender satisfies these constraints, based on the target parameters specified for each constraint (such as IS-04 Flow attributes and SDP format-specific parameters)

IS-RX-CAPS has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initiative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifications.

The formal specification is provided in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-receiver-capabilities). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which are specified in RAML and JSON Schema).

The links to documentation, API and examples below and for DOCS and SPEC in the page menu bar are for this release (tag) or branch: **branches/v1.0-dev**. Links to [other releases (tags)](tags/) and [other branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or in the VERSIONS menu.
